# m-ld quadstore query benchmarking
The `index.js` script reads a file from the `data` directory and executes a
number of sample queries, with timings.

The file is a download of raw key/value pairs in binary format from the m-ld
[playground](https://egde.m-ld.org/playground/).

Note that the example domain `punding-encrinal.m-ld.org` contains an
experimental use of Lists for text content.
